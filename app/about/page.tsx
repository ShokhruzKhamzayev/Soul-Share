                <p className='tracking-wide font-medium'>&quot;As an overthinker, I think about any thought for hours, leading me to depression or more. I am very curious and want to know every detailed information as I get interested. Thus, I listen to people a lot but never trust others when it comes to sharing my own thoughts. One day, again sitting and thinking about my private overthinking thoughts, I realized that I keep too much in me, so I started searching for online places where I could share my &quot;things&quot; with strangers I would never see again. However, I could find no place for my exact purpose - to confess my feelings to strangers. At that moment, I thought that there were definitely some people who felt the same way as me, and they needed - we need - a place where we could freely express our private, untrusted-to acquaintances, and harm our mental health thoughts. Keeping too much harms our mental/psychological state, and pouring things out would heal us. Ultimately, I decided to create this project where you can share your thoughts that keep torturing your mind anonymously, along with reading other people's confessions. No one knows anyone â€“ Share your soul, learn from the experiences of others, help, get help, and free your soul to keep your mental health good.&quot;</p>
